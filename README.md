TesraPunKu-Innovation
=====================================
#### Verifiable off-chain computing

Verifiable computing means that customers can outsource some computing tasks to untrustworthy third parties that have sufficient computing power. The calculation result and the proof of the validity and completeness of the result will be returned to the customer together, and the customer then only needs to do a verification calculation without performing the original calculation task.<br/>
For each computing request, a group of computing nodes is randomly selected, and each group member performs deterministic computing tasks, and sends back the results agreed by the majority of nodes.<br/>

#### Zero Knowledge Proof (zkSNARK)

Construct a verifiable computing network based on zero-knowledge proof (zkSNARK), which executes off-chain, verifies off-chain, and improves verification efficiency based on threshold keys.<br/>
The off-chain calculation based on zkSNARK only needs to be executed once. The solver and verifier are non-interactive. The proof is concise, meaning it is small and has nothing to do with the complexity of the calculation. The verification process can quickly verify the validity of the calculation results. It only depends on the size of the input and is not affected by the complexity of the calculation process.<br/>
